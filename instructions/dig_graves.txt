#  dig_graves.py extracts/reports data for a collection of stashed "Find a Grave" memorial pages.
#
#  Schema:
#   log = create a log file
#   cemetery_id-nickname : group, group, ...
#   cemetery_id = numeric Find a Grave cemetery ID
#   -nickname = cemetery abbreviation for spreadsheet tab name
#   valid groups = burial, parent, spouse, child, sibling, half-sibling
#   Colon (:) separates cemetery_id and groups
#   Comma (,) separates groups
#   cemetery_id without group(s) will convert to include all groups.
#
#  Groups are not currently used by dig_graves.py.
#  If "log" appears by itself on a line, start a log file.
#
#  Examples:
#   2136908 : child
#   2136908 : burial, parent, spouse, child, sibling, half-sibling
#   2136908 (converts to ...)
